<p><h3> I'm 29 years old and live in Omaha, Nebraska (middle of the US). I am currently a college student working on my bachelors in IT Innovation at UNO 
(University of Nebraska at Omaha.)For those who do not know what IT Innovation is, a simple explanation is that it is a hands on program that is 
preparing students for the future. In the IT Innovation major, students learn basic IT skills, such as programming, cyber security, application 
development, statistics, business practices, etc. In addition, the major allows us freedom to chose any elective class offered by the University, 
as long as it will help our degree program and give it direction, and as long as it is relevant to the IT Innovation degree. </p>

<p> The 11 elective classes, which is called the area of emphasis, is where many of my fun and exploratory classes come in. Through my area of emphasis, 
I am taking a few journalism classes, an entrepreneurship class, digital art classes, a creative writing class, and one or two international studies 
courses. Going forward into the future, I have many classes coming up that will improve my current skills and teach me new ones. </p>

<p> I am set to graduate in May 2023, which is only 1 and a half years away! With only 10 classes left, it feels so close! </p>

<p> After I graduate I plan to go to earn my Masters degree. As for a location, I am set on Scandinavia, but I am still deciding exactly where, although I 
do have my choices narrowed down to Sweden, Norway, or Iceland. I am actually in a bit of a quandary right now, as I was thinking of going to school in 
Sweden, as they have a program that would match me perfectly, but recently the migration agency put a law into effect that makes it very difficult to 
obtain permanent residency, which is my ultimate goal. </p>

<p> With that change in effect, I am a little more weary of going to school in Sweden. As of now, I am zoning in on Iceland, as I found a program there that 
would also fit me perfectly. I would absolutely love to study in Iceland, and permanent residency looks easier to get there at the moment. I would also 
enjoy learning Icelandic, as it is a beautiful language, I love watching Icelandic movies, TV shows, or listening to Icelandic music! </p>

<p> As I have one year left before I need to start applying for Master's programs, I am so glad I have been looking into them early, there is so much to 
consider, more on that in a few articles posted on my news blog! </p>
