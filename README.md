* ITIN Area of Emphasis - This page talks about one of the sections of my degree program and explains it more. My area of emphasis is important because it not only talks about the   type of classes I am taking on the side, but it also says a lot about me and my personality, as all of the classes (hand picked by me) have a creative flair to them.
